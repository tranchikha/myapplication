Critical
This is a device-critical service. If it exits more than four times in four minutes, the device will reboor into recovery mode.

Specify a class name for the service. All services in a named class may be started or stopped together.

Onrestart
Execute a command when service restarts

 

zygote : start Android Java VM Runtime and start system server. Itâ€™s the most important process.

mediaserver : start AudioFlinger, MediaPlayerService and CameraService.
mediaserver => AudioFlinger => AudioHAL => audio kernel.
sp<ProcessState> proc(ProcessState::self());
        sp<IServiceManager> sm = defaultServiceManager();
        ALOGI("ServiceManager: %p", sm.get());
        AudioFlinger::instantiate();
        MediaPlayerService::instantiate();
        CameraService::instantiate();
        AudioPolicyService::instantiate();
        registerExtensions();
        ProcessState::self()->startThreadPool();
        IPCThreadState::self()->joinThreadPool();

 

After the above steps are completed,  Zygote launches the system services.  The Zygote forks a new process to launch the system services.
